# 📘 Foundations of R for Bioinformatics

This repository contains materials for a three-part R and RNA-seq data analysis course delivered as part of the MRes Research Skills module at the University of Birmingham.

## 🧭 Course Overview

The course is designed to introduce MRes students to:
1. **R programming** using a tidyverse-first approach  
2. **Data visualisation and wrangling** in R  
3. **RNA-seq data analysis**, including differential expression and pathway analysis  

Each session is two hours long and builds progressively in difficulty and independence.
